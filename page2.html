  <p>The Toronto Maple Leafs are one of the "Original Six" NHL teams. Being one of the Original Six teams means you are one of the six oldest teams in NHL history. </p>
  <span><p>Founded in 1917, the Toronto Maple Leafs are recognized as one of the oldest teams in NHL history. The other teams that are apart of the Original Six era are the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens and New York Rangers.</p></span>
  <span><p>Given how old the Toronto Maple Leafs are as an NHL team, it would make sense that they would have a lot of success. Well it's true, they do.</p></span>
  <span><p>The Toronto Maple Leafs have the second most Stanley Cups in NHL history (13 Stanley Cups), behind another Original Six team; the Montreal Canadiens, who have won 24 Stanley Cups. Nevertheless, that is very impressive. However, the Leafs haven't been able to win a Stanley Cup recently.</p></span>
  <span><p>And by recently, I mean in 55 years. Yes you saw that correctly, that was not a typo. The Leafs haven't won a Stanley Cup since 1967, which is the longest NHL cup drought in NHL history. </p></span>
